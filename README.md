## OT-Project
Real Tibia Redesigned

------------


### Changes
#### Server Side
- Creatures
	- Experience Generation
	- Gold Generation
	- Item Drops
	- Attack/Defense/Armor
	- Static Attack (Randomness of creature movements)
	- Monster Levels (Based upon difficulty)

- Gold System
	- Less gold is generated by monsters.
	- Non humanoids no longer drop gold. But still drop creature products, which can be sold.
	- Items cost less and will sell for less at NPCs. Some items that were once buyable are no longer buyable.
	- Item worth / Gold exchanged balanced.

- Weapons
	- More spears are added to the game. Spears no longer start at 30 attack.
	- Wooden Spear: 10 Attack (Level 2+ Average) | Stone Tipped Spear: 15 Attack (Level 8+ Average) | Knight Spear: 20 Attack (Level 12+ Average)
    
#### Client Side
- Sprites
	- Sprites of some items are changed to reflect a new style. Taken from 7.4-10.98 as well as OT Sprite Pack and being hand made by me.

- Lighting
	- Lighting is changed for various light sources found throughout the game to reflect a darker atmosphere, for a better RPG experience.
	- Ambient lighting is removed from the game and defaults to 0. There will be no ambient lighting in this project.
